=head1 NAME

Bot::ChatBots::Messenger::Sender - Bot::ChatBots Sender for Messenger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Bot::ChatBots::Messenger::Sender;

   my $sender = Bot::ChatBots::Messenger::Sender->new(
      token => $ENV{TOKEN}, # mandatory!
   );

   my $specific_sender = Bot::ChatBots::Messenger::Sender->new(
      token => $ENV{TOKEN}, # mandatory!
      recipient => $ENV{RECIPIENT_ID},
   );

   $sender->send(
      {
         message   => {text => 'Aloha'},
         recipient => {id   => $some_id},
      }
   );

   # simple text suffices if there's a default recipient
   $specific_sender->send('Hello, how are you?');

   # well, just try to figure it out by yourself. Here `$input_record`
   # is some record received e.g. by Bot::ChatBots::Messenger::WebHook
   $sender->send('text message', $input_record);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a sender for Facebook Messenger.

=head1 ACCESSORS

The following methods have a same-named option that can be passed to the
constructor.

=head2 B<< token >>

   my $token = $obj->token;

Accessor for the token. This MUST be provided upon creation of the object.

=head2 B<< url >>

   my $fb_messenger_url = $obj->url;

The Facebook Messenger API endpoint. Defaults to
L<https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/messages>.

=head1 METHODS

It should be safe to override the following methods in your classes
composing this role.

=head2 B<< normalize_message >>

   my $output = $obj->send_message($message); # OR
   my $output = $obj->send_message($message, $input_record);

This method is called by L</send_message> to do some magic on the provide
C<$message> and try to make life easier while using this object.

In particular, a Messenger message is required to have the following
structure:

   {
      message   => {text => $your_message},
      recipient => {id => $your_recipient_id},
   }

If the input C<$message> is a hash reference, the C<message> part is
supposed to be OK.

If the C<recipient> part is missing, it is possibly auto-filled based on
the following algorithm:

=over

=item *

if a C<$input_record> is provided, then the C<<
$input_record->{sender}{id} >> is taken from it;

=item *

otherwise, if the L<Bot::ChatBots::Role::Sender/has_recipient> method
returns a true value, then L<Bot::ChatBots::Role::Sender/recipient> is
used;

=item *

otherwise an exception is thrown (L<Ouch> with code 500).

=back

=head2 B<< send_message >>

   $obj->send_message($message); # OR
   $obj->send_message($message, $input_record);

Do actual sending of a message. This method leverages
L<Bot::ChatBots::Role::Sender/ua_request> L</ua_request> to do the actual
network traffic.

See L</normalize_message> for what is accepted as input.
